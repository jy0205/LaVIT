# ICLR 2024: Unified Language-Vision Pretraining in LLM with Dynamic Discrete Visual Tokenization

[[`arXiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04669)] [[`BibTeX`](#Citing)]

This is the official repository for the multi-modal large language models: **LaVIT**.

## News and Updates

* ```2024.04.21``` üöÄüöÄüöÄ We have updated the code for downstream tasks evaluation and the visualization notebook of the LaVIT decoder for reconstructing the input images.

* ```2023.11.17``` üëèüëèüëè We further improve LaVIT's image generation capability. In the updated version ([LaVIT-v2](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/LaVIT-7B-v2)), the **aesthetic** and **prompt-alignment** of generated images has been improved. The **probability of watermark** is also greatly reduced. The improvements are summarized as follows:
  * Using LaVIT to generate better synthetic captions for the noisy Laion-Aesthetic (Like DALL-E 3). 
  * Add the high-aesthetic training images from the open-source JourneyDB dataset.
  * Using the 20M synthetic Laion-Aesthetic data and 4.2M JourneyDB data to further finetune the LLM for 8K steps.

* ```2023.10.31``` üåüüåüüåü We update the high-resolution pixel decoder in **LaVIT**, which supports to generate high resolution (1024 * 1024 pixels), muliple aspect ratios (1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 ...) and high aesthetics images. The quality of generated images have been improved siginificantly.

* ```2023.10.17``` üöÄüöÄüöÄ  We release the pre-trained weight for **LaVIT** on the HuggingFace and provide the inference code of using it for both multi-modal understanding and generation.


## Future Schedules

- [ ] The finetuning code for LaVIT
- [ ] Further improve the multi-modal image synthesis performance of LaVIT, including multi-modal image editing, subject-driven image synthesis ...
- [ ] Improve the image synthesis speed.


## Introduction
We propose **LaVIT**, a new general-purpose multi-modal foundation model that inherits the successful learning paradigm of LLM: predicting the next image / text token in an auto-regressive manner. LaVIT introduces a well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that LLM can read. Hence, both images and texts can be handled simultaneously under the unified generative objective. For more technical details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04669).

</div><br/>


After pre-training, LaVIT can serve as a multi-modal generalist to perform both multi-modal comprehension and generation without further fine-tuning. Specifically, it has the following capabilities:

* Read image contents, generate the captions and answer the questions.
* Text-to-image creation.
* Image synthesis via Multi-modal Prompt.

## Examples

### High Quality Text-to-Image Creation. 
LaVIT can synthesize **high quality (up to 1024 * 1024)**, **muliple aspect ratios**, and **high aesthetics** images based on the given image prompt, whose image generation ablility is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (Parti, SDXL, and DALLE-3). The following are some examples.

</div><br/>


### Image synthesis via Multi-modal Prompt. 

Since both image and text are unified as discrete tokens in LLM, **LaVIT** can accept several modality combinations (e.g., text, image+text, image+image) as prompt to generate corresponding images without any fine-tuning.

</div><br/>

### Read image contents and answer the questions.

Given the input images, LaVIT can read the image content and understand its semantics. For example, our model can give the caption for input image and answer the corresponding questions.

## Setup

### Requirements

The code for this repo is tested with PyTorch 1.13.1 and CUDA 11.7.
You should first install and configure the Pytorch Environment (including torch and torchvision) can then install the requirements with the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jy0205/LaVIT.git
cd LaVIT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* (Optional) We recommend using memory efficient attention by installing xFormers following the instructions in [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/optimization/xformers). Then, you can set the argument `use_xformers=True` in `build_model` function to save the GPU memory and speed up inference.

### Model Zoo
We release the LaVIT weight that is built upon [Llama-2-7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) as the large language model. The latest pre-trained weight of LaVIT can be found on the huggingface, which will take around 26GB of disk space. We strongly recommend you to download and use the latest version: [LaVIT-v2](https://huggingface.co/rain1011/LaVIT-7B-v2), since the image generation capability of this version has been greatly improved.

> Note: Due to the license restrictions of Llama1, we cannot publish its weights. Thus, we release the weight of LaVIT based on the Llama2. 


LaVIT achieves state-of-the-arts performance on various multi-modal downstream tasks. The detailed quantitive results are shown as follows:

## Usage
LaVIT can serve as a multi-modal generalist to perform both multi-modal comprehension and generation. Below, we provide some examples. Only a few lines of code are needed to use **LaVIT** for inference. We also provide the detailed examples in the following jupyter notebooks for learning how to interact with LaVIT. 

* `understanding.ipynb` : examples for multi-modal understanding
* `text2image_synthesis.ipynb`: examples for the text-to-image generation.
* `multimodal_synthesis.ipynb`: examples for image synthesis with multi-modal prompts.
* `image_detokenize.ipynb`: examples for image reconstruction from the discrete image tokens.

### Multi-modal Understanding

```python
import os
import random
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from models import build_model
from PIL import Image

seed = 1234
random.seed(seed)
torch.manual_seed(seed)

# The local directory you save the LaVIT pre-trained weight, 
# it will automatically download the checkpoint from huggingface
model_path = '/path/LaVIT_weight'

# Using BFloat16 during inference
model_dtype = 'bf16'  # Or set to fp16 to enable float16 inference

# Inference using GPU-0
device_id = 0
torch.cuda.set_device(device_id)
device = torch.device('cuda')

# Building LaVIT for understanding and load its weight from huggingface
model = build_model(model_path=model_path, model_dtype=model_dtype,
            device_id=device_id, use_xformers=False, understanding=True)
model = model.to(device)    

# Image Captioning
image_path = 'demo/caption_image.jpg'
caption = model.generate({"image": image_path})[0]
print(caption)
# an old photo of a horse and buggy in front of a building

# Visual Question Answering
image_path = 'demo/qa_image.jpg'
question = "What's that drink in the glass?"
answer = model.predict_answers({"image": image_path, "text_input": question}, max_len=10)[0]
print("The answer is: ", answer)
# The answer is: orange juice
```

### Text-to-Image Synthesis

For the Image generation, the Classifier-Free Guidance scale is important. A larger scale will encourage the model to generate samples highly related to the input prompt while sacrificing the image quality. We set `guidance_scale_for_llm=4.0` by default, you can increase this scale (e.g., 5.0 or 6.0) to encourage the generated image to follow the semantics of given prompts. Besides, you can modify the `ratio` to enable to generate the images with different aspect ratios.

```python
import os
import torch
import random
import torch.nn as nn
from models import build_model
from PIL import Image

seed = 1234
random.seed(seed)
torch.manual_seed(seed)

# The local directory you save the LaVIT pre-trained weight, 
# it will automatically download the checkpoint from huggingface
model_path = '/path/LaVIT_weight'

# Using BFloat16 during inference
model_dtype = 'bf16'    # Or set to fp16 to enable float16 inference

# Inference using GPU-0
device_id = 0
torch.cuda.set_device(device_id)
device = torch.device('cuda')
torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16 if model_dtype=="bf16" else torch.float16

# Building LaVIT for Generation and load the weight from huggingface
# You can set `use_xformers=True` if have installed xformers to save GPU mempry and speed up
model = build_model(model_path=model_path, model_dtype=model_dtype, device_id=device_id,
       use_xformers=False, understanding=False, load_tokenizer=False)
model = model.to(device)    

# Text-to-Image Generation
prompt = "a sculpture of a duck made of wool"

# LaVIT support 6 different image aspect ratios
ratio_dict = {
    '1:1' : (1024, 1024),
    '4:3' : (896, 1152),
    '3:2' : (832, 1216),
    '16:9' : (768, 1344),
    '2:3' : (1216, 832),
    '3:4' : (1152, 896),
}

# The image aspect ratio you want to generate
ratio = '1:1'
height, width = ratio_dict[ratio]

with torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch_dtype):
    images = model.generate_image(prompt, width=width, height=height, 
    num_return_images=1, guidance_scale_for_llm=4.0, num_inference_steps=25)

images[0].save("output/i2t_output.jpg")
```

## Evaluation

We provide the zero-shot evaluation with multiple GPUs on the adopted multi-modal benchmarks for reproductivity. You can refer to the scripts in the `scripts` folder for detailed usage. For convenience, you can download the annotations from [here](https://disk.pku.edu.cn/link/AAB1235C308C8D43BE86F1D4AA85B58853), which also provides the evaluation dataset structure. Before evaluation, you need to download the images from the official dataset websites to the corresponding directory in the `data/*/images` folder.
